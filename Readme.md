OVERVIEW :

The Search Auto-Complete project is designed to provide real-time search suggestions based on user input. It helps users find relevant results efficiently by predicting their queries as they type. The system utilizes a pre-defined dataset and applies efficient search techniques to return matching suggestions.

Tech stacks Used : 
-Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework (DRF)
-Database: SQLite(can use any other just need to add the database details in Settings.py)
-Search Optimization: Trie Data Structure or Full-Text Search

Setup

1.Clone the Repository
	-git clone https://github.com/aDiTyA-2712/Search-Auto-Complete.git
	open it in VScode and in the terminal do : cd Search-Auto-Complete
	
2.Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
	- python -m venv venv
	- source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
	
3.Install Required Dependencies	
	- pip install -r requirements.txt
	
4.create SuperUser
	- python manage.py createsuperuser
	enter your admin details
	This is used to login to admin panel and add the data on which this query will be done.

5.Apply Migrations & Seed Initial Data
	- python manage.py makemigrations
	- python manage.py migrate
	
6.Run the Django Development Server
	- Python manage.py runserver
	
How It Works
1.User Input & Search Query:

	When a user starts typing in the search box, the frontend makes an API request to fetch relevant suggestions.
	
2.Data Retrieval & Matching:

	The backend processes the input and searches for matching records using Trie or Full-Text Search techniques.
	

3.Response Generation & Display:

	The server returns a list of possible matches, which is displayed to the user in real-time.

Future Enhancements
✅ Improve Performance with Redis Caching – Cache frequently searched queries for faster responses.
✅ Machine Learning Integration – Use AI-based search ranking to improve auto-complete accuracy.
✅ Personalized Suggestions – Adapt search suggestions based on user preferences and history.
✅ Support for Multi-Language Search – Expand functionality to support searches in different languages.
✅ Deploy the Service to AWS/GCP – Make the project available in production environments with scalability.
